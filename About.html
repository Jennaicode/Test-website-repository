  <h1>About Our Dragons</h1>
    <p class="bordered-paragraph">
        Mermaids killed the dragonâ€™s parents and the mermaids were super hungry for power because they currently have no power because they are weak.  The dragons stole a mystical artifact called the pearl of the mermaids. So in return the mermaids are trying to steal the dragonian scale that holds the power of all the elements. Other thing to note about the dragonia scale is that is it forged with special lava that helps build its power.
      <br>       Dragons are super nice and are blacksmiths in their free time. They use their skills to craft weapons and there is no need to train because they are experts. SO NO SCHOOL REQUIRED!!! They like to eat rocks , coal , veggies, magna rocks, and omnivores. The kive in the largest cave in hawaii. Dragon are scared of the human because they like to attack them this why they kive in the Volcanoes. Volcanic area they live because they like warm climates. Their weakness is human and water.

       <br>   The name of the cave they live in (undecided), when they are not working they love to sitt on the beach and enjoy a hot magma soda.

  <h1>The Ugly Dragon</h1>
    <p class="bordered-paragraph" style="border-color: purple;">  
        Once upon a time, in the depths of the ocean where sunlight could barely penetrate, there lived a Mother dragon. She guarded her nest nestled within a coral reef, patiently awaiting the hatching of her eggs. When the time came, cracks appeared on the eggs, and one by one, baby dragons emerged into the world.
        Among the newborn dragons' sleek and powerful forms, there was one that appeared different. It was smaller, clumsier, and its scales were duller. The other dragons scoffed and ridiculed it, calling it "ugly" and "awkward." The poor creature, unaware of its appearance, tried to fit in but was met with disdain.
        As days turned into weeks, the dragon felt increasingly isolated and out of place. With a heavy heart, he swam away from the coral reef, hoping to find a place where he could belong.
        The dragon journeyed through the vast expanse of the ocean, encountering various sea creatures who mocked its appearance. Feeling disheartened, he pressed on until one day, he stumbled upon a magnificent underwater kingdom.
        In this enchanted kingdom, graceful mermaids swam in intricate coral palaces, their tails shimmering with iridescent scales. The dragon approached the mesmerizing creatures, hoping for acceptance. However, the mermaids, with their haughty gazes, sneered at the dragon, taunting it for its appearance.
        Feeling dejected, the dragon retreated, swimming deeper into the ocean until it found a hidden grotto where bioluminescent creatures danced in the darkness. Among them was a wise old turtle who sensed the dragon's sadness and offered words of comfort.
        With renewed determination, the dragon returned to the coral reef, determined to prove his worth. He practiced his swimming skills and honed his abilities until he became a graceful and agile swimmer.
        One day, as the dragon glided through the ocean currents, he stumbled upon a group of mermaids in distress, caught in a tangle of seaweed. Without hesitation, the dragon sprang into action, using his strength to free the mermaids.
        Grateful for the dragon's bravery and kindness, the mermaids apologized for their previous behavior and welcomed the dragon into their midst. Together, they swam through the ocean depths, exploring hidden wonders and forging a bond of friendship.
        And so, the dragon discovered that his true beauty lay not in outward appearance but in the purity of his heart and the courage to embrace his uniqueness. From that day forward, he lived happily ever after, surrounded by love and acceptance in his new home among the mermaids.
        Along the way, the dragon couldn't help but crack a joke or two, adding a touch of humor to their underwater adventures. His dad jokes, though groan-inducing, brought laughter and joy to his newfound friends, making their journey all the more memorable. And if you made this far this story was a joke. MERMAIDS ARE THE ENEMY NOT DRAGONS.
