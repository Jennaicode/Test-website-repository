 <p>Mermaids killed the dragonâ€™s parents and the mermaids were super hungry for power because they currently have no power because they are weak.  The dragons stole a mystical artifact called the pearl of the mermaids. So in return the mermaids are trying to steal the dragonian scale that holds the power of all the elements. Other thing to note about the dragonia scale is that is it forged with special lava that helps build its power.</p>

Dragons are super nice and are blacksmiths in their free time. They use their skills to craft weapons and there is no need to train because they are experts. SO NO SCHOOL REQUIRED!!! They like to eat rocks , coal , veggies, magna rocks, and omnivores. </P><br>
